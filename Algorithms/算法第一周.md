## Dynamic Connectivity
How many connected components result after performing the following sequence of union operations on a set of 1010 items?

1–2 3–4 5–6 7–8 7–9 2–8 0–5 1–9

3
正确 
**The connected components are \{0, 5, 6\}{0,5,6}, \{3, 4\}{3,4}, and \{1, 2, 7, 8, 9\}{1,2,7,8,9}.

-----------------------------------
## Quick Find
What is the maximum number of \verb#id[]#id[] array entries that can change (from one value to a different value) during one call to union when using the quick-find data structure 
on nn elements?

n - 1正确 
In the worst case, all of the entries except \verb#id[q]#id[q] are changed from \verb#id[p]#id[p] to \verb#id[q]#id[q].

------------------------------
## Qucik Union
1.Suppose that in a quick-union data structure on 10 elements that the \verb#id[]#id[] array is

   i  |  0|  1|  2|  3|  4|  5|  6|  7|  8|  9
-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
id[i] |  0 | 9 | 6|  5|  4|  2|  6|  1|  0|  5


Which are the roots of 3 and 7, respectively?

6 and 6

正确 
The root of 33 is 66: \; 3 \rightarrow 5 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 6 3→5→2→6.

The root of 77 is 66: \;7 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 9 \rightarrow 5 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow6 7→1→9→5→2→6.

2.What is the maximum number of array accesses during a find operation when using the quick-union data structure on nn elements?

linear

正确 
See slide 27.

## Weighted Quick Union
Suppose that the \verb#id[]#id[] array during the weighted quick-union (by size) algorithm is given as below. Which \verb#id[]#id[] entry changes 
when we apply the union operation to 33 and 66?

\verb#id[8]#id[8]

正确 
In weighted quick-union (by size), we make the root of the smaller tree (in terms of the number of nodes) point to the root of the larger tree.
So, in this example, the algorithm sets \verb#id[8] = 0#id[8]=0.

## Union Find Application
When opening one new site in the percolation simulation, how many times is union()union() called?


0, 1, 2, 3, or 4

正确 
It is called for each neighboring site that is already open. There are 4 possible neighbors, but some of them may not already be open

# ALlgorithm Analysis

Suppose that nn equals 1 million. Approximately how much faster is an algorithm that performs n \lg nnlgn operations versus one that performs n^2n 
2
  operations? Recall that \lglg is the base-2 logarithm function.

50,000x

正确 
{n^2} \;/\; (n \lg n) \;=\; n \; /\; \lg n \;= n 
2
 /(nlgn)=n/lgn= 1,000,000 / lg(1,000,000). Since 2^{20}2 
20
  is approximately 1 million, we obtain approximately 50,000.
